In installable version all files EXCEPT: AlternativeDesktop.py/.exe should be editable without needing to recompile/build. 
(obviously if you do large devwork or try to add imports etc. it will likely not work if those modules are not installed, 
but changing text etc. should be doable if you know what you are doing without needing to create a dev environment for python with everything installed.)

I added AlternativeDesktop.py to give a readable version of what happens in AlternativeDesktop.exe, without needing to pull up the github.

Check logs: C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/AlternativeDesktop/logs

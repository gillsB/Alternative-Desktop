### New desktop engine:
- Replaced the desktop library with a QGraphicsView

### Improvements with the new engine:
- Faster launching. (~50% faster)
- Faster resizing/redrawing the screen.
- Icons have static positions (Old system used to scale padding based on max rows/columns).
- Lower ram usage
- Text outline is now possible (Was almost impossible in old engine)
- Multi line comments now word wrap and fit within assigned space (For now hard capped at 3 lines)

### Other (non-engine) improvements:
- Edit Icon menu now appears relative to Icon position. (No longer appears in the center of the window).
- Dragging icons now shows a closed hand cursor
- Running auto generate icon now shows a loading cursor (rare cases can take a few seconds to auto generate icons).

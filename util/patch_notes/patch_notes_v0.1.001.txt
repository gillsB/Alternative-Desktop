### Settings:
- New settings "Max rows" and "Max Columns" settings in settings menu
- New setting "Icon Name color" which allows you to change the color of the desktop icon labels (names)
- New setting "On closing the program" which allows you to set the program to minimize to tray, or terminate the program on X close, or right click -> close window.
- Added a "None" theme which uses the default Qt theme instead of the Qt-Material theme system.(Light mode with dark gray background)
- New setting "When in focus Keybind" which allows the user to either have the keybind minimize it to windows taskbar or have it minimize to system tray (hidden)

### New Improvements:
- All desktop icons now auto-preview before saving
- Added logging to better trace errors/bugs
- Minimizing to tray, When "On closing the program" setting is set to Minimize to tray, Closing the program will hide the program and remove it from windows taskbar. The program will still respond to keybind to bring it up, and can be restored or completely closed out through the windows tray.
- Un-maximizing the screen now shows the program in the center of the screen at 75% monitor width, 75% monitor height for the first time it is unmaximized on a monitor. (Previously it would be a tall awkwardly sized window starting from the center of the screen, likely too tall to fit entirely on the screen).
- Warning messages text are now selectable (for copy/pasting)
- Open Executable Location (right click menu) now opens parent directory if the Executable Path does not exist. And shows an error if neither exist (previously would only open if the executable path existed).
- Organized util files into /util , desktop files into /desktop , and other widgets/dialogs/menus into /menus

### Bugfixes:
- Fixed a bug which left icons in edit mode upon Esc key closing a desktop icon edit.
- Fixed a problem causing almost all situations to call for Auto Generating an icon. (Wrong reference to a web_link line edit which compared the existence of the line edit NOT the text in the line edit)
- Fixed a bug which allowed someone to save settings with no toggle overlay keybind set. Also stopped this from crashing on launch if this somehow occurs.
- Fixed a problem where auto generation of icons for default associated apps/programs would crash. It now tries multiple times to get a valid icon return, in the extreme extreme case that nothing returns it sets the icon to unknown.png.
- Fixed a problem with some settings not properly declaring changes to have been made, thus allowing you to close settings without a prompt "Do you wish to discard these changes?"
- Fixed a bug where program would not resize below a certain height due to rendering rows in the grid.

### For future updates going forward(This is only for V0.1.001 updating to V0.1.002+)
- Updating now displays a menu asking the user if they want to download and install a new update (Only displays if "Update on Launch" setting is turned on).
- Dialog window with a progress bar to show download progress for the update.
- Fixed cleanup after downloading update (Was in temp folder so would get cleaned up eventually, but now should also be deleted after installing).

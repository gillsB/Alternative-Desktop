### Greatly improved video background playback.
- Completely redesigned desktop icon storage format for better performance (Dictionary instead of 2d array).
- Caching icons to prevent endlessly redrawing (Would lag the video background player).
- Fixed multiple bugs causing endless redrawing (bugs which would endlessly redraw even cached icons).
- Video Background now seamlessly loops (Fixed a problem where end of video would remove it from the scene and take ~0-1 seconds before it would be reloaded at the start).


### Other Improvements:
- Icons now maintain their aspect ratio. (Instead of being forced into a square aspect ratio icon).
- Pausing video playback on settings/ right click menu.
- Default (blank) icons now have their own right click menu (just has edit rather than reusing the full context menu for a set icon).
- Desktop Icons now show tooltip of full icon Name on hovering the Icon name text area.
- Improved logging to better detect endless redrawing.
- Improved logging to better log full errors for debugging.
- Some smaller errors no longer instantly crash the program. (Can cause delayed crashing, like upon changing icon sizes etc and saving. If you see this check the log for distinct error messages)

### Bug fixes:
- Fixed a bug where setting Icon Name Color would not show the updated color selected.

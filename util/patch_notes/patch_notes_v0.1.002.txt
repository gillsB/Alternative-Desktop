Small patch to fix some important things which unintentionally got left out of last patch in workflow.

### New Improvements:
- If update downloaded but not installed, upon next run it asks if you want to just install from found file or redownload and install.

### Bugfixes:
- Fixed a problem with installer not including patch_notes folder, thus not showing these patch notes :(

### Video and Image background improvements
- Reworked the way image backgrounds are displayed, they are fixed in size rather than resizing dynamically with the window.
- Fixed a major issue where resizing the window horizontally caused the video background to shrink. It now behaves like the new image background.
- Added horizontal, vertical, and zoom adjustment options for image backgrounds.
- Added a custom background fill and color setting, enabling users to select a custom color for the background fill.
- Added a "Display order" setting when "Background Sourcing" is set to "Both", allowing the user to choose whether the video background or the image background appears on top.

### other improvements
- Moderately optimized video and image backgrounds. Removed pointless reloading and optimized creation and movement.
- Menus no longer pause video background.
- Video and image background adjustment sliders now only appear when a background of that type is possible.
- Attempting to force close the window while the Settings menu is still open, now prompts the user if they wish to discard the changes before closing.

### bug fixes
- Swapping themes in settings menu no longer pauses the video background.
- Ensured proper deletion of tray icon upon close.
- Fixed an issue where the window would briefly appear minimized upon keybind restore, even if it wasnâ€™t actually minimized.
- Fixed a bug where swapping two icons would not update both images if the icon image files had the same name.

### Settings menu changes
- Menu is now resizable
- Added a tab for background settings to consolidate them.
- Menu now dynamically sizes it self to match content. (Was fixed size).

### Smaller changes and bugfixes
- Menu can no longer be taller/wider than screen (Maxes out at screen height minus some padding for windows taskbar).
- Some fields only appear if they are relevant (Video background settings only appear if it is possible for a video background to be used).
- Better non-mouse navigation (Tab now selects items that were unselectable in old version, and "Enter" key now works on selections like a user would expect).
- Better at showing focus (Some default things like sliders do not show a border when selected, they now do).
